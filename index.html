    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently a <strong>Ph.D. student at Southeast University</strong>, focusing on 
      <strong>high-precision positioning</strong> and <strong>multi-source information fusion</strong> 
      for intelligent transportation systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      My research interests lie in <strong>multi-source fusion localization</strong>, 
      <strong>autonomous driving</strong>, and 
      <strong>vehicle–road–cloud collaborative positioning</strong> 
      in complex urban and low-altitude environments. 
      I aim to enhance the <strong>robustness</strong>, <strong>accuracy</strong>, and 
      <strong>real-time performance</strong> of navigation and localization algorithms 
      under <strong>GNSS-degraded or denied conditions</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my master’s studies, I conducted extensive research on 
      <strong>GNSS carrier phase–based positioning</strong>, including 
      <strong>cycle slip detection and repair</strong>, as well as 
      <strong>tight coupling of GNSS and IMU systems</strong>. 
      Building upon this foundation, my current work explores the integration of 
      <strong>heterogeneous sensors</strong> (e.g., LiDAR, cameras, IMU, GNSS) 
      and <strong>deep learning models</strong> to improve the reliability and adaptability 
      of <strong>navigation and perception</strong> in autonomous systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond research, I am passionate about <strong>intelligent transportation</strong>, 
      <strong>urban mobility</strong>, and the <strong>application of AI-driven sensor fusion</strong> 
      in real-world navigation scenarios. 
      My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of 
      <strong>robust, scalable, and intelligent localization systems</strong> 
      that support safer and more efficient autonomous transportation.
