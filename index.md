# About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at **Southeast University**, specializing in **high-precision positioning and multi-source information fusion** for intelligent transportation systems.

My research focuses on **multi-source fusion localization**, **autonomous driving**, and **vehicle–road–cloud collaborative positioning** in complex urban and low-altitude environments. I am particularly interested in improving the **robustness and real-time performance** of navigation algorithms under **GNSS-degraded or denied conditions**.

During my master's studies, I worked extensively on **GNSS carrier phase-based positioning**, including **cycle slip detection and repair**, and **tight coupling of GNSS/IMU systems**. My current work extends toward **integrating heterogeneous sensors** and **deep learning models** to enhance the reliability of positioning and perception in autonomous systems.

Beyond my research, I am passionate about **intelligent transportation**, **urban mobility**, and **the application of AI-driven sensor fusion** in real-world navigation scenarios.
